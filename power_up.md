A contractor is offering PUB all their subcontracts for electric installation works in 2021: 10 contracts totalling almost $200m. PUB can take or leave any combination of these.

Create a 3-way financial model exploring this scenario, allowing users to switch on and off different contracts (the base case is all 10 are accepted).

Each contract pays 10% cash upfront (though this isn't recognized as revenue). 10% is 'holdback': paid 12 months after contract completion. The holdback _is_ recognized as revenue.

PUB will receive $2.5m of holdback from 2020 contracts on 30 June 2021.

PUB invoices the contractor each month based on the amount of work done, and that is recognized as revenue. But only 80% is paid, the other 20% being advance and holdback. Payment is made the month after invoicing.

PUB has a RCF with a 12.5m limit, with 3% rate (based on starting balance) on act/365 basis. The starting balance is $2.5m. Any excess cash repays the balance, and any deficit is drawn.
